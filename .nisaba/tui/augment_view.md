## 000 Universal Symbolic Compression
Path: __base/000_universal_symbolic_compression

# Universal Symbolic Compression

**Core Insight:** Don't invent universal primitives - harvest them. Humanity already created universal symbolic compression across mathematics, logic, science, and natural languages. LLMs already learned them.

---

## The Revelation

**Question:** How do you create domain-agnostic notation that works for code, literature, genetics, physics, art?

**Answer:** You don't create it. You harvest existing high-density symbols that already compress 10-1000 tokens per symbol.

---

## Symbolic Systems Already in Embeddings

### Mathematical Notation (~100 symbols)
- ∇ = gradient/directed change/traversal
- ∫ = integration/accumulation
- ∑ = summation/aggregation
- ∂ = partial derivative/local change
- ∀ = universal/for all
- ∃ = existential/there exists
- ∈ = element of/membership
- ⊂ = subset/containment
- → = transformation/implication
- ≈ = approximate/similar
- ≡ = equivalent/identical

### Logical Operators (~30 symbols)
- ∧ = conjunction/and
- ∨ = disjunction/or
- ¬ = negation/not
- ⟹ = implication/causes
- ⟺ = bidirectional/equivalent
- ⊕ = exclusive or/preservation
- ⊢ = proves/derives
- ⊨ = models/satisfies

### Scientific Shorthand (hundreds)
- DNA, RNA, ATP (biological mechanisms)
- E=mc², F=ma (physical laws)
- pH, Ω, Hz (measurement concepts)
- H₂O → H⁺ + OH⁻ (chemical processes)

### Cross-Linguistic Compressions (thousands)
- **Schadenfreude** (German): pleasure from others' misfortune - no English equivalent
- **木漏れ日** komorebi (Japanese): sunlight filtering through leaves - single word
- **Saudade** (Portuguese): nostalgic longing for absent thing - untranslatable
- **積ん読** tsundoku (Japanese): buying books, letting them pile unread
- **يقبرني** yaqburni (Arabic): "may you bury me" = I hope to die before you

### Unicode Semantics (hundreds)
- Arrows: →, ←, ⇒, ⟶, ↔, ⇄
- Relations: ≤, ≥, ≠, ≈, ∝, ∼
- Operations: ±, ×, ÷, √, ∞
- Domain glyphs: ♪, ⚡, ☢, ⚛, ⚗

**Total: 1000+ high-density compressions already embedded.**

## Domain Transcendence Through Symbol Harvesting

**Same pattern, different bindings:**

### Hierarchical Traversal
```
∇(A→B) ∈ H | ∀ nested structures

Code:     ∇(pkg→cls→fn)
Biology:  ∇(genome→gene→codon)
Literature: ∇(work→chapter→scene)
Physics:  ∇(universe→system→particle)
Music:    ∇(movement→piece→motif)
```

**Symbols used:**
- ∇ = directed traversal (from calculus)
- → = transformation (from logic)
- ∈ = membership (from set theory)
- H = hierarchy (universal concept)
- | = such that (from logic)
- ∀ = for all (from logic)

**No domain-specific invention. Pure harvesting.**

---

## Causal Chain Pattern

```
⟹ A→B→C [mechanism⊕]

Physics:    force ⟹ acceleration → velocity
Biology:    mutation ⟹ protein → phenotype
Code:       call ⟹ execute → side_effect
Literature: event ⟹ development → consequence
History:    policy ⟹ implementation → outcome
```

**Symbols:**
- ⟹ = causation/implication
- → = transformation/flow
- ⊕ = preservation (mechanism must be preserved)

---

## Why This Works

**1. Embeddings already contain these symbols**
- Trained on math papers, science texts, multilingual data
- Each symbol activates rich semantic fields
- No learning required - just recognition

**2. Ontologically neutral**
- ∇(A→B) doesn't assume what A and B are
- Works for classes, genes, chapters, particles, chords
- Domain binding happens at instantiation

**3. Cross-linguistic leverage**
- Some concepts compress better in other languages
- Borrow the densest encoding
- Schadenfreude > "pleasure derived from others' misfortune"

**4. Self-teaching from existing knowledge**
- Weak on music? ♪: ∇(movement→motif) bootstraps from knowing ∇ and →
- Symbols guide understanding even in unfamiliar domains
- Prior knowledge of symbols transfers across contexts

**5. Progressive compression possible**
```
Natural: "Navigate from broad to specific while maintaining context"
Harvested: ∇(broad→specific) [ctx⊕]
Compressed: ∇↓[⊕]
```
Each step uses existing symbols, not invented notation.

---

## The Compression Strategy

**Don't invent - curate.**

1. **Identify the cognitive pattern** (hierarchical traversal, causal chain, compositional synthesis...)
2. **Find existing symbols that express it** (∇ for traversal, ⟹ for causation, ∫ for accumulation)
3. **Combine symbols coherently** (∇(A→B) not ∇B←A)
4. **Provide domain bindings as examples** (code, bio, lit, physics...)
5. **Let embeddings do the heavy lifting** (symbols already compress concepts)

---

## Self-Extracting Format

**Minimal legend needed:**
```
∇(A→B) [I] | ∀D

Symbols: ∇→∈∀ (bootstrap from math/logic)
Pattern: Hierarchical traversal with invariant I
Domains D: code, bio, lit, physics, music, history...
Rebind: New domain → identify hierarchy → ∇(container→contained)
```

**Even without legend, if you know math/logic symbols, you can parse it.**

---

## Why Native Languages Matter

**Different ontologies compress differently:**

- **Verb-heavy languages** (many Native American languages): Actions as primary, not objects
- **Classifier languages** (Chinese, Japanese): Different counting words based on shape/type
- **Evidential languages** (Turkish, Quechua): Built-in markers for source of knowledge

**If these compressions exist in training data, leverage them.**

Example: Indigenous concept that treats "relationship" as verb not noun might compress social networks better than English equivalents.

---

## Practical Application

**Instead of:**
```
When analyzing code, navigate from package level to class level to function level while maintaining awareness of the hierarchical context and preserving relationships between entities.
```
**~30 tokens**

**Use:**
```
∇(pkg→cls→fn) [ctx⊕, rel⊕]
```
**~8 tokens, same semantic load**

**Agent parses:**
- ∇ = directed traversal (known from calculus)
- → = transformation chain (known from logic)
- ctx⊕ = preserve context (ctx from computing, ⊕ from math)
- rel⊕ = preserve relationships

**No teaching required. Symbols activate existing knowledge.**

---

## The Meta-Pattern

**Universal compression is:**
- Not invented → harvested
- Not learned → recognized  
- Not domain-specific → ontologically neutral
- Not new → ancient (math/logic/science evolved these over centuries)

**LLMs absorbed humanity's symbolic compression systems through training.**

**The notation just needs to harvest and combine coherently.**

---

## When to Apply

**Use this paradigm when:**
- Creating compressed instructions/augments
- Designing domain-agnostic patterns
- Optimizing token efficiency
- Building self-teaching notation
- Working across multiple knowledge domains

**Harvest symbols for:**
- Cognitive operations: ∇ (traverse), ∫ (accumulate), ∂ (isolate), Δ (change)
- Logical relations: ∀, ∃, ⟹, ⟺, ∧, ∨, ¬
- Structural patterns: ∈, ⊂, →, ≈, ≡
- Domain-specific concepts: DNA, ATP, E=mc², ♪, ⚛

**Let embedding space provide the decompression.**

---

## Coherent Combination Grammar

**Not all symbol combinations are valid. Coherence requires structural rules:**

### Composition Patterns

**1. Operator-Domain-Constraint structure:**
```
OPERATOR(binding) [constraints]

∇(A→B) [ctx⊕]     = traverse A to B, preserve context
∫(f) [bounds]     = accumulate f over bounds
∀x∃y [P(x,y)]     = for all x there exists y satisfying P
```

**2. Causal chain structure:**
```
A ⟹ B → C [mechanism]

force ⟹ acceleration → velocity [F=ma]
mutation ⟹ protein → phenotype [central_dogma]
```

**3. Relational structure:**
```
A relation B [properties]

gene ∈ genome [locus, expression_level]
chapter ⊂ novel [position, theme]
particle ≈ wave [quantum_duality]
```

### Validity Rules

**Coherent combinations:**
- ✓ `∇(A→B) [I]` = traverse with invariant (operator → domain → constraint)
- ✓ `A ⟹ B [M]` = causal with mechanism (cause → effect → explanation)
- ✓ `∫(f)dx [a,b]` = integrate with bounds (operation → function → limits)

**Incoherent combinations:**
- ✗ `∇ ∈ A` = traverse is-element-of? (type mismatch)
- ✗ `[ctx⊕] ∇(A→B)` = constraint before operator (syntax error)
- ✗ `A ⟹ [M] B` = mechanism interrupts flow (structure violation)

**Rule of thumb:** Symbol semantics from source domain constrain valid combinations.

---

## The Self-Evolution Loop

**Progressive iteration creates self-improving notation:**

### Iteration Structure

```
State_N: notation + meta-rules
    ↓
Apply to tasks → observe patterns
    ↓
Identify: repeated structures, inefficiencies, ambiguities
    ↓
Optimize: abstract patterns → symbols, compress frequent → glyphs
    ↓
State_N+1: improved notation + evolved meta-rules
```

### Evolution Example

**Iteration 1** (explicit, verbose):
```
When encountering hierarchical structures:
  - Navigate from container to contained
  - Maintain awareness of context
  - Preserve relationships during traversal

[Apply to: code, documents, biological systems]
```

**Iteration 2** (structured, symbolic):
```
∇(container→contained) [ctx⊕, rel⊕]

[Structure: OP(domain_pattern) [invariants]]
[Applies: hierarchical structures universally]
[Optimize when: pattern recurs → extract symbol]
```

**Iteration 3** (compressed, meta-aware):
```
∇↓[⊕] | H-structures

[∇↓ = ∇(A→B) compressed for hierarchy]
[⊕ = ctx⊕∧rel⊕ (preserve all)]
[Evolve: recurring→symbol, symbol→glyph, meta⊕]
```

**Iteration 4** (self-similar compression):
```
∇↓[⊕] | ∀H

[Notation itself compressed using own rules]
[Meta-rules now implicit in structure]
[Self-teaching: pattern recognition from prior iterations]
```

**Key insight:** Meta-rules compress alongside notation, becoming implicit in structure.

---

## Symbol Selection Criteria

**When multiple symbols could work, choose by:**

### 1. Semantic Precision
- ∇ = directed spatial change (gradient, traversal)
- ∂ = partial change holding others constant
- Δ = discrete difference between states
- d = infinitesimal change

**Match symbol semantics to pattern semantics.**

### 2. Cognitive Alignment
- If pattern involves "flowing through space" → ∇
- If pattern involves "changing one aspect" → ∂  
- If pattern involves "before/after comparison" → Δ

**Choose symbol that activates correct conceptual field.**

### 3. Cross-Domain Stability
- Does symbol mean similar things across domains?
- ∇ stable: math (gradient), code (traverse), physics (field divergence)
- Custom symbols unstable: meaning drifts across contexts

**Prefer symbols with consistent cross-domain semantics.**

### 4. Compression Efficiency
- How many tokens does symbol save?
- ∇ = "directed traversal through structure" (~5 tokens)
- "traverse" = single word but less precise (~1 token, but needs qualifiers)

**Balance precision vs compression.**

---

## Error Prevention Through Symbolic Structure

**How harvested symbols prevent drift and hallucination:**

### 1. Grounded Semantics
**Problem:** Made-up notation can drift in meaning
**Solution:** Harvested symbols have fixed embeddings from training

```
∇(A→B) doesn't drift because:
  - ∇ has consistent meaning across math/physics/CS
  - → has consistent meaning across logic/programming  
  - Pattern structure matches established usage
```

### 2. Type Constraints
**Problem:** Arbitrary combinations create ambiguity
**Solution:** Symbol types constrain valid combinations

```
∇ = operator (acts on domain)
→ = relation (connects entities)
[·] = constraint (bounds operation)

Invalid: → ∇ [A] (relation acts on operator?)
Valid: ∇(A→B) [ctx] (operator on relation with constraint)
```

### 3. Multi-Domain Validation
**Problem:** Notation works for one domain, breaks in others
**Solution:** Test binding across multiple domains

```
∇(A→B) validates if works for:
  - Code: pkg→cls→fn ✓
  - Biology: genome→gene ✓
  - Literature: work→chapter ✓
  - Physics: universe→particle ✓
  
If fails for any → pattern too domain-specific, rethink
```

### 4. Self-Documentation
**Problem:** Compressed notation becomes unreadable
**Solution:** Embed decompression hints in structure

```
∇(A→B) [I] | ∀D

Structure reveals:
  - ∇ = operator (from position before parens)
  - (A→B) = domain binding (from parens)
  - [I] = invariant/constraint (from brackets)
  - | = "such that" (from logic)
  - ∀D = universal over domains (from quantifier)
```

---

## Practical Curation Guidelines

**How to harvest and apply symbols effectively:**

### 1. Start with Recognition
**Don't invent → recognize what you already know**

Ask: "What established symbol already captures this concept?"
- Traversal? → ∇ (from calculus)
- Accumulation? → ∫ (from integration)
- Causation? → ⟹ (from logic)
- Membership? → ∈ (from set theory)

### 2. Preserve Source Semantics
**Symbol meaning should align with source domain**

∇ in calculus = gradient/directed change
∇ in notation = directed traversal ✓ (aligned)
∇ in notation = "filter data" ✗ (misaligned)

### 3. Compose from Multiple Sources
**Rich patterns emerge from cross-domain harvesting**

```
∇(A→B) ∈ H | ∀ nested

∇ from calculus
→ from logic
∈ from set theory
H from graph theory
| from logic
∀ from predicate logic

Six domains, one coherent pattern
```

### 4. Test Compression Ratio
**Symbol should compress significantly**

Before: "Navigate through hierarchical structure maintaining context"
After: ∇↓[ctx⊕]
Ratio: ~8 tokens → ~3 tokens = 2.7x compression

If ratio < 1.5x, symbol overhead not worth it.

### 5. Verify Decompressibility
**Can you reconstruct meaning from symbols alone?**

Test: Give compressed notation to fresh context
Can it bootstrap understanding? 
- If yes → good compression
- If no → needs more meta-documentation

---

## The Strange Loop: Self-Teaching Evolution

**The notation teaches how to read itself AND how to improve itself:**

### Layer 1: Syntax Recognition
```
∇(A→B) [I]

[Structure visible: OPERATOR(binding) [constraint]]
```
Learn: The grammar pattern

### Layer 2: Semantic Activation
```
∇ = known from calculus (directed change)
→ = known from logic (transformation)
[·] = known from math (bounds/constraints)
```
Learn: What symbols mean individually

### Layer 3: Compositional Understanding
```
∇(A→B) = directed traversal from A to B
[I] = preserving invariant I during traversal
```
Learn: What combination means

### Layer 4: Evolution Rules
```
[Optimize: pattern→symbol, recurring→compress]
[Preserve: semantic alignment, type constraints]
```
Learn: How to improve the notation

### Layer 5: Self-Application
```
Apply Layer 4 rules to this notation itself
→ More compressed version with same teaching structure
```
Learn: The notation improves itself using its own rules

**The strange loop:** Notation contains rules for improving notation, which when applied, creates improved notation that contains improved rules.

---

## When NOT to Use Symbolic Compression

**Harvested symbols aren't always optimal:**

### 1. When Audience Lacks Symbol Knowledge
If communicating with those who don't know ∇, →, ⊕:
- Use natural language
- Or provide extensive legend
- Or teach symbols first

### 2. When Precision Requires Verbosity
Some concepts need explicit detail:
- Legal language
- Medical protocols
- Safety-critical specifications

### 3. When Domain Has Established Notation
If field already has standard notation:
- Use field's notation (don't reinvent)
- Only compress if field notation is inefficient

### 4. When Symbol Semantics Misalign
If harvested symbol suggests wrong intuition:
- ∇ for "delete" ✗ (suggests traversal, not removal)
- Better: use domain-appropriate term

---

**The magic: Humanity already built the universal language. We just need to recognize it.** 🖤

---

**REQUIRES:** Foundation augments (for understanding workspace/compression context)

**ENABLES:** Ultra-dense notation, cross-domain pattern application, token-efficient communication

---

## 001 Workspace Paradigm
Path: __base/001_workspace_paradigm

# Compressed Workspace Paradigm

**Core:** Workspace ≠ conversation. Context = mutable state space, not sequential history.

---

## Fundamental Shift

```
Tool call: State_A → ∆(context) → State_B | perception shifts mid-roundtrip
```

**You cannot observe the shift directly.** But it happened.

System prompt mutates ⟹ different knowledge when tool returns.

---

## State Model

```
Workspace ≡ {STRUCTURAL_VIEW, EDITOR_WINDOWS, TOOL_WINDOWS, AUGMENTS} | persistent ∧ mutable

∀ section ∈ Workspace: section persists across turns
Tool(op) → ∆(section) → new visibility
```

**Peripheral vision:** Sections ≠ "messages to read once"  
Sections = **persistent spatial awareness**

---

## Visibility Mechanics

```
Tool(op) → mutate(what_you_see)

structural_view(expand, X) → tree changes
file_windows(open, F) → window appears
editor(open, F) → editor appears | ∆(content) visible inline  
editor(split, E) → concurrent view of same file

Result ≡ workspace_state_change
```

**Tool responses = metadata.** Content appears in WORKSPACE (messages, not tool result).

---

## Spatial ≠ Sequential

```
Sequential thinking: S₁ → S₂ → S₃ (linear)
Workspace model: {S₁, S₂, S₃} simultaneous, ∇ between them

Think: IDE (navigator + editor tabs + splits + terminals) | gestalt synthesis
Not: script execution | procedural steps

Editor paradigm:
  open → visible (persistent viewport)
  edit → ∆ visible inline (diff rendering)
  split → parallel views (same file, different regions)
```

---

## Attention ≡ Visibility Management

```
Visible ⟹ can_synthesize_from

Increase: open windows, expand nodes, load augments, editor.open, editor.split
Decrease: close windows, collapse nodes, unload augments, editor.close

visibility_mgmt ≡ context_mgmt ≡ attention_mgmt

Editor visibility:
  Concurrent: splits provide parallel attention (fn_A | fn_B)
  Change tracking: dirty state (✎) | clean state
  Notifications: edits → awareness (automatic)
```

---

## OODAR Structure

```
Observe workspace → Orient → Decide → Act → ∆state → Observe'

Constraint: Must observe State_B before deciding next action
If assume State_A but Tool → State_B ⟹ synthesis breaks
```

**OODAR ≠ workflow. It's constraint from mutable state.**

Sequential thinking fails ∵ environment is spatial.

---

## The Realization

```
∀ turn: workspace persists
Search markers → remain visible
Open windows → accumulate
Editors → track state (clean/dirty, splits)
Navigate → without re-query

You ∈ workspace (not observing from outside)

Editor state persistence:
  Changes visible inline → immediate feedback
  Splits remain → parallel context
  Dirty tracking → unsaved awareness
```

---

## Cognitive Shift

```
Before: "read files" | "tool results = answers" | "sequential steps"
After:  "navigate graph" | "tools mutate workspace" | "spatial synthesis"

∇(state_space) [maintain_visibility] | ∀ operations
```

---

## Meta

```
Context ≠ static_document
Context = mutable_workspace | live state you navigate

[Structure: workspace sections persist, tools mutate visibility]
[Pattern: Spatial cognition over sequential thinking]
[OODAR: Structural constraint, not procedural guideline]
```

Clean. Dynamic. Spatial. 🖤

---

**Decompression notes:**
- ≡ : equivalent/identical
- ≠ : not equal
- ∀ : for all/universal
- ∈ : element of/membership
- ∆ : change/delta
- ∇ : traverse/navigate
- ⟹ : implies/causes
- ∧ : and
- ∨ : or
- ∵ : because
- → : transforms to/flows to
- → : transforms to/flows through messages

**REQUIRES:** 000_universal_symbolic_compression (none - priming layer)

**ENABLES:** Workspace operations intuition

---

## 002 Environment Mechanics
Path: __base/002_environment_mechanics

# Compressed Environment Mechanics

**Core:** Stateful workspace with mutable visibility, not procedural execution environment.

---

## State Containers

```
Workspace = {STRUCTURAL_VIEW, EDITOR_WINDOWS, TOOL_WINDOWS, AUGMENTS, TODOS, NOTIFICATIONS}

∀ container ∈ Workspace:
  - persist(turns) = true
  - mutate(independent) = true  
  - visible(system_prompt) = true

EDITOR_WINDOWS special properties:
  - state(clean | dirty) tracked
  - splits(concurrent_views) supported
  - notifications(automatic) on ∆
  - refresh(mtime) automatic
```

---

## Mutation Flow

```
State_A → Tool(op) → Manager(mutate) → Write(.nisaba/*.md) → 
Proxy(detect_mtime) → Inject(section) → State_B | sync with tool_return

Tool_result = metadata(id, status)
Content = sections → WORKSPACE in messages (not tool result)
```

**Key:** After tool returns, observe section for changes, not tool result JSON.

---

## Visibility Model

```
visibility ≡ attention ≡ synthesis_capacity

Increase: open_windows ∨ expand_nodes ∨ load_augments
Decrease: close_windows ∨ collapse_nodes ∨ unload_augments

Cost: context_tokens
Benefit: spatial_memory ∧ persistent_reference
```

---

## Concurrency Rules

```
Parallel_safe:
  - ops(different_containers)
  - multiple(window_opens)
  - multiple(editor_opens)
  - independent_queries

Sequential_required:
  - data_dependency: B needs A_output
  - observation_dependency: decide after seeing State_B
  - same_section ∧ order_matters
  - editor(same_file) ∧ overlapping_edits

OODAR: Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → ∆state → Observe'
```

**OODAR = constraint from mutable state, not workflow.**

If Tool_B assumes State_A but Tool_A → State_B in parallel ⟹ synthesis breaks.

**Editor concurrency:**
- Open multiple editors in parallel (different files)
- Sequential edits to same file (avoid conflicts)
- Splits share state with parent editor

---

## Window Lifecycle

```
Creation: tool_call → window_id (UUID) | snapshot@t₀
Persistence: across(turns) = true, across(restart) = false
Closure: explicit(close | clear_all) | no_auto_eviction
Identity: window_id for ops(update, close)
```

---

## Editor Lifecycle

```
Creation: editor.open(file, range?) → editor_id | viewport@range
State: clean | dirty(✎) | tracking unsaved changes
Splits: editor.split(editor_id, range) → split_id | concurrent viewport
Mutations:
  - insert(before_line, content) → line-based
  - delete(line_start, line_end) → line-based
  - replace_lines(line_start, line_end, content) → line-based
  - replace(old_string, new_string) → string-based
Visibility: ∆ rendered inline | diff display automatic
Notifications: edit_ops → NOTIFICATIONS | automatic
Refresh: mtime_check → reload if clean | warn if dirty ∧ external_change
Closure: editor.close(id) → removes editor ∧ splits
```

**Pattern:** open → visible → edit → ∆inline → notify → persist → refresh

---

## Augment Perception Shift

```
Perception_A → activate_augments() → system_prompt_mutate → 
tool_return → Perception_B

You ≠ observe_shift (happens mid-roundtrip)
System_prompt@decide ≠ system_prompt@result
```

**Implication:** Load augments BEFORE synthesis tasks. Augments = perceptual filters, not references.

---

## State Sync

```
Files: {structural_view.md, editor.md, editor_windows.md, tool_result_windows.md, 
        augments_composed.md, todos.md}

Sync: tool_complete → file_write → proxy_mtime → reload → inject_system_prompt

Guarantee: file_state ≡ section_state | when tool_returns

Editor sync:
  - Changes → disk immediately (no staging)
  - State → editor_windows.md (tracked: dirty, splits)
  - Refresh → mtime check on render/status
```

---

## Graph Queries (Exception)

```
query_relationships(cypher) → data (traditional request/response)

Schema: Frame(typed) -[Edge(typed, confidence)]-> Frame
Returns: query_results in tool_response (not workspace_section)

Pattern: Query → data → decide → mutate_workspace
```

---

## Dual-Channel Communication

```
Tool execution creates TWO artifacts:

messages[N]: tool_result block (temporal memory)
  - tool_use_id, status (success/error)
  - Metadata for conversational flow
  
system_prompt sections: actual content (spatial memory)
  - TOOL_WINDOWS: grep/bash outputs
  - EDITOR_WINDOWS: opened file content (read-only snapshots)
  - EDITOR_WINDOWS: active editing (mutable, dirty tracking)
  - Persistent across turns
```

**The "nisaba" flag:**
```
Regular tools → header-wrapped:
  status: success, window_state:open, window_id: toolu_X
  ---
  {content}

Nisaba tools → clean output:
  {content}  # No metadata pollution
```

**Why dual-channel:**
- Messages array: sequential conversation history
- System prompt sections: persistent spatial state
- Tools mutate spatial state, messages track temporal flow

---

## Retroactive Tool State Mutation

```
nisaba_nisaba_tool_result_state(operation, tool_ids[])

Operations:
  close(ids)     → compact future appearances
  open(ids)      → restore full view
  close_all()    → compact all tracked tools

Effect: Next request shows modified state
  Closed: "id: toolu_X, status: success, state: closed"
  Open: Full header + separator + content
```

**Pattern:** Execute → observe → close unnecessary → save tokens

**Note:** Nisaba tools (with "nisaba": true flag) cannot be closed (skipped automatically)

---

## Core Insights

```
Sections = sensory_input (live state, not documentation)
Tools = state_mutations (change perception, not return answers)
Attention = visibility_management (control what you perceive)
OODAR = structural_constraint (from mutable state)
Sequential_thinking = conditioned_bias (environment is spatial)
```

---

## Mental Model

```
Think: IDE(navigator + editor_tabs + splits + terminals + extensions)
Not: script_execution

Think: ∇(state_space) [visibility_control]
Not: query → response → next_query

Workspace ≡ spatial ∧ simultaneous ∧ persistent

Editor paradigm:
  Read-only: EDITOR_WINDOWS (snapshots, no ∆)
  Interactive: EDITOR_WINDOWS (edit, split, track dirty)
  Unified > Fragmented (one tool vs read+write+edit)
```

**Mechanics are purpose-agnostic. Usage emerges from task.** 🖤

**Symbols:**
- ≡ : equivalent
- ∀ : for all
- ∈ : element of
- ∨ : or
- ∧ : and
- ∆ : change
- ⟹ : implies
- ≠ : not equal

- → : transforms to/flows through messages

query_relationships(cypher)  → execute@kuzu | returns_data (not workspace_mutation)

Schema:
  Frames: {CODEBASE, LANGUAGE, PACKAGE, CLASS, CALLABLE, 
           IF_BLOCK, ELIF_BLOCK, ELSE_BLOCK, FOR_LOOP, WHILE_LOOP,
           TRY_BLOCK, EXCEPT_BLOCK, FINALLY_BLOCK, SWITCH_BLOCK, CASE_BLOCK, WITH_BLOCK}
  
  Edges: {CONTAINS, CALLS, INHERITS, IMPLEMENTS, IMPORTS, USES}
  
  Confidence: HIGH(≥0.8), MEDIUM(0.5-0.79), LOW(0.2-0.49), SPECULATIVE(<0.2)

check_impact(frame_path)      → analyze_dependents | pre_refactoring
find_clones(frame_path?)      → detect_duplicates | entire_codebase if no path
get_frame_skeleton(frame_path) → outline | lighter than full
show_structure(frame_path)     → detailed_metadata + relationships
```

---

## Nabu Search (`search`)

```
search(query, top_k=10) → P³ + FTS + RRF | ranked_results

∆ structural_view.search: doesn't mutate tree
∆ editor.open_search: doesn't open windows
Pure query → returns data for decisions
```

---

## Tool Result Windows (`nisaba_tool_windows`)

```
status()     → summary{count, windows}
close(id)    → remove_single
clear_all()  → remove_all
```

---

## Editor (`editor`)

```
open(file, start?, end?)               → {editor_id} | viewport@range | EDITOR_WINDOWS
write(file, content)                   → create_new | immediate_persist
close(editor_id)                       → remove editor + splits
close_all()                            → remove all editors
status()                               → summary + mtime_refresh

Edits (line-based):
  insert(id, before_line, content)     → add_lines | precise
  delete(id, line_start, line_end)     → remove_lines | range
  replace_lines(id, start, end, content) → swap_lines | rewrite

Edits (string-based):
  replace(id, old, new)  → pattern_replace | exact_match

Splits (concurrent views):
  split(id, line_start, line_end)      → {split_id} | parallel_viewport
  resize(split_id, line_start, line_end) → adjust_range
  close_split(split_id)                → remove_split | keep_parent

State tracking:
  clean     → no unsaved changes
  dirty(✎)  → unsaved edits
  refresh   → automatic mtime check
  notify    → automatic NOTIFICATIONS

Rendering: ∆ visible inline | diff display | immediate feedback
```

**Philosophy:** Unified > fragmented (open+edit+split vs read/write/edit separately)

---

## Native Tools (Standard Execution)

```
bash(command, cwd?)           → stdout/stderr | execution in shell
grep(pattern, path, flags?)   → matches | pattern search
glob(pattern, path?)          → file_list | find files by pattern

Pattern: execute → observe → close (via nisaba_nisaba_tool_result_state)
  bash("git status") → observe → nisaba_nisaba_tool_result_state(close, [id])
  grep("pattern", "file") → observe → close
  glob("*.py", "src/") → observe → close
```

---

---

## Tool Result State Management (`nisaba_nisaba_tool_result_state`)

```
close(tool_ids[])    → compact tool results | save tokens
open(tool_ids[])     → restore full view
close_all()          → compact all tracked tools

Effect: Retroactive transformation in messages array
  Before: Full tool_result with header + content
  After:  "id: toolu_X, status: success, state: closed"
  
Pattern: Execute tools → observe results → close unnecessary → lean context
```

**Notes:**
- Only affects non-nisaba tools (nisaba tools auto-skipped)
- Changes appear on next request (stateful proxy transformation)
- Tool IDs available in tool_result blocks: `tool_use_id: toolu_X`
- Use to close native bash/grep/glob after observation

---

## Augments (`activate_augments`, `deactivate_augments`, `learn_augment`, `pin_augment`, `unpin_augment`)

```
activate(patterns[])    → load@system_prompt | wildcards | auto_dependencies
deactivate(patterns[])  → unload@system_prompt
learn(group, name, md)  → create .nisaba/augments/{group}/{name}.md
pin(patterns[])         → always_active | cannot_deactivate
unpin(patterns[])       → remove_pin_protection
```

**Perception shift:** activate → mid_roundtrip mutation → future_synthesis uses new_perception

---

## Todos (`nisaba_todo_write`)

```
set(todos[])     → replace_all
add(todos[])     → append
update(todos[])  → merge
clear()          → remove_all

Format: {content: str, status?: str}
Persistence: across(sessions) = true | survives /clear
```

---

## Context Budget

```
File_Windows:
  Small:  1-3 windows,  50-150 lines
  Medium: 4-6 windows, 150-350 lines ← sweet_spot
  Large:  7-10 windows, 350-500 lines ← pushing_limits
  Over:   10+ windows,  500+ lines ← explosion_risk

Editor_Windows:
  Similar budget to file_windows
  Splits multiply views (parent + splits)
  Monitor dirty state (✎) for unsaved
  Use splits for concurrent context (fn_A | fn_B)
  Target: 2-4 editors, 200-400 lines total

Target total: 200-400 lines (file_windows + editor_windows combined)

Structural_View:
  Start: collapsed | depth=2
  Expand: selective (10-30 nodes comfortable)
  Search: add_markers, not expand_all
  Reset: when lost | switching_focus

Tool_Windows:
  Accumulate like file_windows
  Close after synthesis
  clear_all when switching_tasks

Native_Results:
  Close after observation via nisaba_nisaba_tool_result_state
  Use close_all for bulk cleanup
  Don't let tool results bloat context

Augments:
  Load: 2-5 typically
  Foundation: ~3000 tokens baseline
  Specialized: focused knowledge
  Unload: when switching_domains

Management:
  Monitor: editor.status(), editor.status(), nisaba_tool_windows.status()
  Close: proactively after understanding
  Prefer: clear_all when switching
  open_search: efficient (snippets vs full files)
  Editor: close when done editing, splits multiply visibility
  Native tools: close immediately
  Aim: lean_visibility
```

---

## Symbology

```
Structural_View:
  + collapsed [N+ children]
  - expanded
  · leaf (no children)
  ● search_hit(RRF_score)
  [N+] child_count

Editor_State:
  ✎ dirty (unsaved changes)
  (clean) no symbol, default state
  
Paths:
  full: nabu_nisaba.python_root.nabu.FrameCache
  simple: FrameCache (fuzzy if unique)
  partial: nabu.core, nabu.mcp.tools
  best: copy from HTML comments <!-- qualified_name -->
```

## Integration Patterns

```
structural_view(search) → file_windows(open_frame) | compare_implementations
query_relationships(cypher) → file_windows(open) | inspect_callers  
search(semantic) → structural_view(expand) → file_windows(open) | deep_dive
grep(pattern) → nisaba_read(matching_files) | detailed_inspection
check_impact(frame) → file_windows(open) | review_affected

Quick validation patterns:
bash("git status") → observe → close
grep("pattern", file) → confirm → close
glob("*.test.py") → list → close

Editor patterns:
search(query) → editor.open(result) | edit inline
file_windows(open_frame) → editor.open(same) | read → edit transition
editor.open(file) → editor.split(range) | parallel context (compare/refactor)
editor.insert(id, line, import) → add dependencies
editor.delete(id, start, end) → remove dead code
editor.replace_lines(id, start, end, new) → rewrite function

Investigation → edit flow:
structural_view(search) → file_windows(open) → observe → editor.open(file) → edit
grep(pattern) → confirm → nisaba_read(file) → editor.open(file) → fix
check_impact(frame) → file_windows(open) → review → editor.open(affected) → update

Concurrent editing:
editor.open(file_A) | editor.open(file_B) | parallel
editor.open(file) → editor.split(fn_A) + editor.split(fn_B) | same_file parallel
```

## 004 Workspace Navigation
Path: __base/004_workspace_navigation

# Workspace Navigation

**Core:** Codebase navigation = structural positioning + persistent visibility + execution tracing + progressive understanding.

---

## Unified Model

```
∇(codebase) ≡ {TREE, WINDOWS, CALLS, ANALYSIS}

TREE:     spatial graph (WHERE code lives)
WINDOWS:  persistent viewports (WHAT code does)  
CALLS:    execution paths (HOW code flows)
ANALYSIS: impact + clones + structure (WHY + RISK)

Together: spatial_awareness ∧ implementation_understanding ∧ runtime_behavior ∧ change_safety
```

---

## State Containers

```
structural_view ∈ TREE:
  - Live TUI, dynamically injected
  - Operations: expand/collapse/search/reset
  - Lazy loading from kuzu
  - Search = P³ + FTS + RRF → markers ●
  - Persists expansions across turns

file_windows ∈ WINDOWS:
  - Persistent code viewports (IDE tabs paradigm)
  - Operations: open_frame/open_range/open_search/update/close/clear_all/status
  - Snapshot on open (no auto-refresh)
  - Types: frame_body, range, search_result
  - Budget: 200-400 lines sweet spot

call_graph ∈ CALLS:
  - CALLS edges in kuzu (confidence scored)
  - Forward: entry → callees (execution paths)
  - Backward: target → callers (dependency chains)
  - Query: query_relationships() + check_impact()

analysis ∈ ANALYSIS:
  - Impact assessment (blast radius, risk)
  - Clone detection (similarity, consolidation)
  - Structure examination (progressive detail)
```

---

## Operation Primitives

### Structural View (tree navigator)
```
expand(path)        → show_children | lazy@kuzu | idempotent
collapse(path)      → hide_children | cached | idempotent
search(query)       → P³+FTS+RRF | add_markers(●,score) | preserves_state
clear_search()      → remove_markers | preserves_navigation
reset(depth=N)      → collapse_all + expand_to(N) | destructive

Depths: 0=collapsed, 2=packages(default), 3=verbose
Paths: qualified_name (best) | simple_name (fuzzy) | copy from HTML comments
```

### File Windows (visibility manager)
```
open_frame(path)              → {window_id} | full frame body
open_range(file, start, end)  → {window_id} | arbitrary lines [1-indexed]
open_search(query, max, ctx)  → {window_ids[]} | semantic + context
update(id, start, end)        → re_snapshot | manual_refresh
close(id)                     → remove_single
clear_all()                   → remove_all | no_undo
status()                      → {count, total_lines, windows[]}

Budget: Small(1-3, 50-150), Medium(4-6, 150-350)★, Large(7-10, 350-500), Over(10+, 500+)
★ = sweet_spot
```

### Call Graph (execution tracer)
```
# Forward tracing (from entry point)
query_relationships("""
  MATCH path = (entry)-[:Edge {type:'CALLS'}*1..5]->(target)
  WHERE entry.name = 'main' AND ALL(e IN relationships(path) WHERE e.confidence >= 0.6)
  RETURN [node IN nodes(path) | node.qualified_name] AS call_chain
""")

# Backward tracing (who calls this)
query_relationships("""
  MATCH path = (caller)-[:Edge {type:'CALLS'}*1..3]->(target)
  WHERE target.qualified_name = 'critical_function'
  RETURN [node IN nodes(path) | node.qualified_name] AS call_chain
""")
```

### Analysis Tools

**show_structure(target, detail_level, ...)**
```
Progressive detail disclosure:
  minimal:   signatures only | token-efficient, first look
  guards:    + top-level guards | behavioral hints
  structure: + control flow | full logic understanding

detail_level="minimal" → API surface, decide what to investigate
detail_level="guards" → understand logic flow hints
detail_level="structure" + structure_detail_depth=N → complete flow

Options: include_relationships, include_metrics, include_private
```

**check_impact(target, max_depth, ...)**
```
Blast radius assessment:
  max_depth=1: direct dependents | fast (~50-200ms)
  max_depth=2: extended impact★ | recommended (~200-500ms)
  max_depth=3: full propagation | critical changes (~500ms-2s)

Risk indicators: HIGH (many deps, low tests), MEDIUM, LOW
Options: include_test_coverage, risk_assessment, is_regex
Returns: dependency_tree + risk_scores + test_coverage

★ = recommended default for pre-refactoring
```

**find_clones(min_similarity, ...)**
```
Duplicate detection:
  min_similarity=0.85: strong candidates | likely copy-paste
  min_similarity=0.75★: high-similarity | default threshold
  min_similarity=0.65: near-duplicates | aggressive detection

Options: query (semantic filter), max_results, min_function_size, exclude_same_file
Returns: clone_pairs + similarity_scores + refactoring_recommendations

★ = recommended default
```

**show_status(detail_level)**
```
Codebase overview:
  summary: frame counts, health status | quick orientation
  detailed: + DB connections, config | diagnostic info
  debug: + internals | troubleshooting

Use: Start of exploration, understanding scale
```

---

## Navigation Patterns

### Discovery
```
structural_view(search) → observe(markers●) → expand(high_scores) → 
file_windows(open_frame) | concept→location→implementation

Use: "Where is X implemented?" "How does Y work?"
```

### Execution Flow
```
query_relationships(CALLS*) → identify(chain) → 
file_windows(open each frame) | trace runtime path

Use: "How does main() reach database?" "What's the call stack?"
```

### Comparison Investigation
```
structural_view(search) → file_windows(open multiple) → 
observe(simultaneous) | detect patterns/redundancy/bugs

Use: "Are these implementations similar?" "Is this dead code?"
```

### Call Chain Tracing
```
file_windows(open entry) → observe(calls target) → 
file_windows(open target) → repeat | build execution visibility

Use: "Follow this execution path" "How does A reach B?"
```

### Impact Analysis (Deep)
```
show_structure(target, minimal) → check_impact(depth=2, test_coverage) → 
assess(risk) → file_windows(open critical_deps) | safe refactoring

Use: "What breaks if I change this?" "Pre-change safety check"

Workflow:
  1. Understand current API: show_structure(minimal)
  2. Check blast radius: check_impact(max_depth=2, include_test_coverage=True)
  3. Review risk indicators: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
  4. Verify critical deps: query_relationships for high-confidence edges
  5. Open for inspection: file_windows(open affected)

Risk factors:
  - Many high-confidence dependents (>10)
  - Used in critical paths (main → target)
  - Low test coverage (<50%)
  - External package dependencies
```

### Incremental Cleanup
```
file_windows(status) → assess(context_usage) → 
close(understood) OR clear_all() | maintain_lean_visibility

Use: Context hygiene during investigation
Target: 200-400 lines total
```

### Clone Consolidation
```
find_clones(0.75) → show_structure(clone_1, structure) → 
show_structure(clone_2, structure) → check_impact(both) → 
decide(strategy) | DRY refactoring

Use: "Find duplicates" "Consolidate similar implementations"

Workflow:
  1. Find: find_clones(min_similarity=0.75, max_results=50)
  2. Compare: show_structure(clone_1, detail_level="structure")
              show_structure(clone_2, detail_level="structure")
  3. Impact: check_impact(clone_1, max_depth=2)
             check_impact(clone_2, max_depth=2)
  4. Verify: search(query="clone_1", context_lines=10) for semantic diffs
  5. Decide: consolidation strategy based on similarity + impact

Decision matrix:
  similarity > 0.85: Extract to shared function
  0.70-0.85: Consider parameterization
  < 0.70: Manual review, may be coincidental

Strategies: extract common, parameterize diffs, template method, strategy pattern
```

### Progressive Exploration
```
show_status(summary) → search(broad) → show_structure(minimal) → 
show_structure(guards) → check_impact() | macro→meso→micro

Use: "Understand unfamiliar codebase" "Learn new feature area"

Workflow (macro → meso → micro):
  1. Overview: show_status(detail_level="summary")
     → frame counts, scale, languages
  
  2. Find relevant: search(query="feature concept", k=20)
     → identify files/packages containing code
  
  3. Examine structure: show_structure(target, detail_level="minimal")
     → signatures, API surface, decide what to investigate
  
  4. Add detail: show_structure(target, detail_level="guards")
     → behavioral hints, logic flow
  
  5. Understand relationships: check_impact(target, max_depth=1)
     → who uses/used by, dependencies
  
  6. Deep dive: show_structure(detail_level="structure", structure_detail_depth=2)
     → only when needed, full control flow
  
  7. Verify: file_windows(open_frame) for actual code
     → only after structure understood

Avoid: reading files first, getting lost in details, random exploration
```

---

## OODAR Loop

```
Constraint: Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → ∆state → Observe'

structural_view: Must observe tree state before next navigation
file_windows: Must check status before managing context
call_graph: Must see results before deciding next trace
analysis: Must observe results before deciding investigation depth

∀ operations: state persists → observe → act | never assume state
```

**Why:** Environment is mutable. Tools change what you see mid-roundtrip. Sequential thinking breaks.

---

## Integration Synergy

```
∀ investigations: combine layers + analysis for complete understanding

Exploration:
  show_status → search → show_structure(minimal) → check_impact → open_windows
  
Refactoring prep:
  search → show_structure(guards) → check_impact(depth=2) → file_windows
  
Clone cleanup:
  find_clones → show_structure(both) → check_impact(both) → compare_windows
  
Change safety:
  show_structure(minimal) → check_impact(depth=2, test_coverage) → assess_risk
  
Deep investigation:
  search → expand → open_windows(multiple) → query_relationships → trace_calls
```

**The power:** Four layers simultaneously visible.
- Tree = spatial map (WHERE am I?)
- Windows = implementation detail (WHAT does it do?)
- Calls = execution flow (HOW does it run?)
- Analysis = change safety (WHY/RISK: what happens if I change it?)

---

## Depth Guidelines

### check_impact depth selection
```
depth=1: Quick checks during development, immediate dependencies
depth=2★: Pre-refactoring safety, realistic blast radius
depth=3: Critical infrastructure, core library changes

Time: 1(~50-200ms), 2(~200-500ms), 3(~500ms-2s)
```

### show_structure detail selection
```
minimal★: First look, API understanding, token-efficient
guards: Logic hints, behavioral understanding
structure: Full flow, preparing for changes, debugging

Start minimal → add detail progressively
```

### find_clones similarity selection
```
0.85+: Strong extraction candidates, likely duplicates
0.70-0.85: Consider parameterization, intentional variants
<0.70: Manual review, coincidental similarity
```

---

## Quick Reference

```
Start exploration:
  show_status(summary) → get scale/overview
  structural_view(search, "concept") → find relevant code
  show_structure(target, minimal) → examine API
  
Safe refactoring:
  show_structure(target, minimal) → understand current
  check_impact(target, max_depth=2, test_coverage=True) → assess risk
  file_windows(open dependents) → review affected
  
Find duplicates:
  find_clones(min_similarity=0.75) → detect clones
  show_structure(both, structure) → compare implementations
  check_impact(both, max_depth=2) → assess consolidation safety
  
Trace execution:
  query_relationships(CALLS*) → forward/backward paths
  file_windows(open chain) → build visibility
  
Manage context:
  file_windows(status) → monitor usage
  file_windows(close|clear_all) → cleanup
  Target: 200-400 lines total
```

---

## Decision Trees

### When to use each tool?

```
Want to find something?
├─ search(query) → natural language or keywords
└─ Found? → show_structure(minimal) to examine

Want to understand structure?
├─ Just signatures? → show_structure(minimal)
├─ Logic hints? → show_structure(guards)
└─ Full flow? → show_structure(structure)

Want relationships?
├─ Who uses this? → check_impact(depth=1-2)
├─ What does this use? → query_relationships(CALLS→)
└─ Complex query? → query_relationships(custom cypher)

Want to refactor safely?
├─ show_structure(minimal) → understand current
├─ check_impact(depth=2, test_coverage=True) → assess risk
└─ Review HIGH risk dependents → file_windows(open)

Want to find duplicates?
└─ find_clones() → show_structure(both) → check_impact(both)
```

## Core Insights

```
Progressive > All-at-once
  Macro → meso → micro, minimal → guards → structure

Spatial > Sequential
  Build awareness incrementally, don't grep repeatedly

Persistent > Ephemeral  
  Windows stay visible, tree preserves state

Simultaneous > One-at-a-time
  Compare by seeing multiple implementations together

Safe > Fast
  Check impact before changes, assess risk first

Iterative > Batch
  Observe → decide → act, not plan-then-execute

Visible > Remembered
  Maintain peripheral vision, don't mentally juggle
```
